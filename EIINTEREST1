// EIINTEREST1 - Buy computers

 

Piccolo is a gaming enthusiast so Piccolo decided to save some money so that by the end of the year he could buy a high-spec computer that could play all of his favorite games.

Every month, Piccolo deposits savings in the bank and the interest rate on the bank each month is fixed.

Piccolo is good at calculating but because it is near the end of the year, Piccolo wants to know how much money he will have to buy the machine.

 

Input
The first line is a non-negative real number X, which is the bank rate per month that Piccolo sends.

The next line is a sequence of 12 non-negative integers (≤ 109) separated by a space, which corresponds to Piccolo's 12-month deposit.

Output
A single line is the amount of money that Piccolo receives at the end of the year.
